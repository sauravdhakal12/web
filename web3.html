		Pokhara is a city on Phewa Lake, in central Nepal. It’s known as a gateway to the Annapurna Circuit, a popular trai  in the Himalayas. Tal Barahi Temple, a 2-story pagoda, sits on an island in the lake. On the eastern shore, the Lakeside district has yoga centers and restaurants. In the city’s south, the International Mountain Museum has exhibits on the history of mountaineering and the people of the Himalayas.
		<br> <br> Pokhara once lay on the important trade route between India and Tibet. To this day, mule trains set up

            camps on the city
            outskirts, bringing goods from remote Himalayan regions including Mustang. Gurungs and Magars, who have
            earned
            world-wide fame as fierce Gurkha warriors, are predominant here. Thakalis, indigenous of the Thak Khola
            region of
            Mustang, are known for their entrepreneurship and run tea houses along the trek routes in the Annapurna
            region. The
            Pokhara is best known for the stunning view of the Annapurna range. It is perhaps one of the few places on
            earth from
            where mountains above 6,000 m can be seen unobstructed from an altitude of 800 m within the distance of 28
            km.
