        <b><em>Minecraft </em></b> is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus
        "Notch" Persson in
        the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May
        2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over
        development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of
        all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.

        In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may
        discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks and simple machines.
        Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against
        other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to
        build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources and access to
        flight. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

        Minecraft received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of the greatest video
        games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played
        large roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach
        chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property
        were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been made, including
        Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth.

    <h2>GamePlay</h2>
    <p>
        Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of
        freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known as
        "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay is in the
        first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person perspective.The game
        world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing various
        materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up
        and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the
        world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many
        commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.The game also contains a material
        known as redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates,
        allowing for the construction of many complex systems.
